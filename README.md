# Sample tokenized ballot contract

This contract contains two main part, the ERC20 token and the ballot.

There are several scripts added so a person can interact with the smart contract using CLI:

1. Casting vote
2. checking the voting power
3. delegating the voting power
4. giving the minting role (currently in control of the ballot contract)
5. give voting token
6. query result

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/*
yarn hardhat deploy
```
